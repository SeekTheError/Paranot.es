Paranot.es is an application that allow user to manage their note in a "safe" way,
By safe, I mean that the notes are encrypted on the client side, so the decrypted version never transit on the network
The encryption method use aes, and the key is the user password. This password does not transit directly on the network either

To install:
you need nodejs, npm and the redis server to run the application
once it's install , simply use  node app.js and open your browser on "localhost:3000"
